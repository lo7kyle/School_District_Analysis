# School_District_Analysis
Analysis of School District data using dataframes with Pandas

## Overview:
In this challenge we are given a task by Maria, a chief Data Scientist of a school district, to gather the math and reading scores from a standardized test across multiple schools. We were tasked to use python and the pandas library to do simple analysis of the data set given to us and create meta-data tables that analyzes budget, school size, school type, and grade level to see what variable affects math and reading scores. 

## Purpose:
The purpose of this challenge is to help us practice using pandas and the data frame library to perform simple analysis that can be otherwise be complex by using a brute force method in python. We are still using python in our analysis however we use the pandas library to do most of the "heavy-lifting" that would require us to use nested for-loops in python. The purpose here is to familiarize ourselves with common Data Science methods that would be used day-to-day.

## Resources
* Data Source: election_results.csv
* Software Python 3.8.8, Conda 4.10.1, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0

## Analysis:

*Code:* 
```python
# Dependencies and Setup
import pandas as pd

# File to Load (Remember to change the path if needed.)
school_data_to_load = "Resources/schools_complete.csv"
student_data_to_load = "Resources/students_complete.csv"

# Read the School Data and Student Data and store into a Pandas DataFrame
school_data_df = pd.read_csv(school_data_to_load)
student_data_df = pd.read_csv(student_data_to_load)

# Cleaning Student Names and Replacing Substrings in a Python String
# Add each prefix and suffix to remove to a list.
prefixes_suffixes = ["Dr. ", "Mr. ","Ms. ", "Mrs. ", "Miss ", " MD", " DDS", " DVM", " PhD"]

# Iterate through the words in the "prefixes_suffixes" list and replace them with an empty space, "".
for word in prefixes_suffixes:
    student_data_df["student_name"] = student_data_df["student_name"].str.replace(word,"")

# Check names.
student_data_df.head(10)
```

    <ipython-input-1-e456d7f40152>:18: FutureWarning: The default value of regex will change from True to False in a future version.
      student_data_df["student_name"] = student_data_df["student_name"].str.replace(word,"")

# Step 1. Import numpy as np.
import numpy as np

```python
# Step 2. Use the loc method on the student_data_df to select all the reading scores from the 9th grade at Thomas High School and replace them with NaN.
# We want only want Thomas High school and 9th graders
tom_9th_df = student_data_df.loc[(student_data_df.school_name =='Thomas High School') & (student_data_df.grade =='9th')]
# check to see if loc worked
print(tom_9th_df)
# choose reading_score column only
tom_9th_df.loc[:, ["reading_score"]] = np.nan
#check to see if selected reading only
print(tom_9th_df)


#replacing reading_scores for 9th graders using np.nan on student_data_df
student_data_df.loc[(student_data_df.school_name =='Thomas High School') & (student_data_df.grade =='9th'), ["reading_score"]] = np.nan

### Overview of the school district analysis: 

- The first step of any analysis is to familiarize ourselves with the data set given to us. We were given two CSVs: one that contains school information such as school type, school size, and budget and the other one student information that contained reading score, math score, grade level, and which school they attended. 

- The second step of this analysis was to make sure the data was cleaned and complete. We shouldn't be working on data that has missing values that would affect our overall analysis and we should be working out of one data set instead of two. In this step we checked for any error in names and removed any silly suffixes or prefixes using python. We used a simple for-loop to replace these suffixes with an empty string. Once we cleaned the name column we were tasked to use the .loc method to replace all of Thomas High School 9th grade class scores with NaN. By combining both pandas and numpy we were able to narrow down to a dataset we wanted and chagned their scores due to a possibility of cheating. Once we replaced our values in data set we combined both our csv so we can have one completed dataframe to do the analysis. This helps prevent any confusion so we can refer to only one dataframe and it is easier to present. 

- The third step would be to do our analysis. Our analysis included finding the count() of students per grade, students per high school and using simple logic operators to find the total passing reading and math count per criteria. To get the percentage per criteria, we took the total passing math/reading count and divided it by the total count. We did a similar analysis with the Per student budget by dividing the total budget by the total number of students. 

- The fourth and final step was to use bins and grouping to tell a clear picture of what criteria affects student scores. Pandas has a powerful tool that help visualize this by creating bins and categorizing data with these bins.  


## Results
Overall there are 15 schools with 39,170 students. From the below image, we can see that the Average Math Score and the Average Reading score are passing scores and individually have greater than 70% of the students passing either Math or Reading; however, the overall passing (meaning passing both reading and math) is roughly 65%.

The overall school Data Frame is below. We can see that the top 5 schools and bottom 5 schools all have different school types and different student counts. We can assume from this brief overview alone that school type and more importantly school size affects a student overall compared to the budget.

### Math and Reading Scores by Grade
The next analysis was analysis of scores by grades. We can see that there is very little correlation between your grade level and your reading level. This is probably due to how English is taught in schools these days. You analysis skills probably will develop due to more exposure; however reading becomes less about understanding grammar and vocabulary and more about analysis of different literature like plays compared to biography. The same can go with math. Every year is taught from Geometry to Calculus. I personally took Geometry in 9th grade and took Calculus in 12th and I can honestly say that I have forgotten a good chunk of geometry since I haven't used it in a long time. If this standardized test is a blend of general math then everyone has just as fair of chance at scoring well.

### Scores by School Spending
From the below screenshot of the data frame we can see that a schools budget isn't indicative of performance. I have grouped school size and school type because those are the indicators of how successful a school will be. Charter Schools are private schools and cost money to attend whereas the district schools are your public schools. Just because Charter schools charge money for enrollment doesn't mean they have a bigger budget. Depending on the school size a school can request for more money from the state or local government. Below is a chart created using bins and labels to categorize the spending per student and the passing rates and scores.

### Scores by School Size & Scores by School Type
School size and school types in my opinion are the most important indicators of the success of a student. It is proven that classes with smaller class sizes have a higher success rate because a teacher can better focus on and have more time per student. A teacher grading 200 homework compared to grading only 100 homework can give a teacher more time for constructive feedback. Yes, there are TA's, however the quality of teaching does go down with more people. With a bigger school you also consider students who are not as fast learners as well. You have a bigger data set with more variables than with a school with a smaller size. This goes hand in hand with school types. Charter schools by default will have less people because why would you pay for someone to go to high school when it is free. This means the people attending charter schools are from affluent families that really focuses on education. These students were probably taught algebra in middle school already and are ahead of the curve. The only reason why you would pay for a charter school is to get your child ahead because you value education. I'm not concluding or even saying that public school systems don't teach at a high caliber or that students care less, I am merely stating that when you surround yourself with people who only want to be the best, you will follow suit.

### Summary:
Taking a look at the results of our analysis we can conclude that school size and school type are indicators of student performance. This is a result of lower student to teacher ratios and the effect of external variables affecting the students. As mentioned above in the results, if parents have to pay for a childâ€™s high school, the parent are affluent and probably come from a higher education background. With students around you that are of higher caliber you will also perform better. We also see that grade level and school spending are not indicators probably due to factors we can't really show with this data set. Where is all this spending going to? We don't have the budget information. We can also see that by removing the 9th graders scores from Thomas High School, the average for THS went up; however, this result might be an outlier. We already see in our results that grade levels don't affect the scores enough to see a possible indicator. 

## Challenges and Difficulties
There were many challenges in this weekâ€™s challenge. One challenge I ran into was not understanding how to use .loc and its importance. I also didn't finish reading the challenge before starting so there were a lot of information I missed. It wasn't until I have already finished the challenge where I went to re-read the deliverables for my analysis where I saw some hints on how to use .loc. This was a mistake on my behalf, but this is also where I felt like I learned the most. When trying replace the THS 9th grader's scores with NaN I didn't know that we could use numpy so I was trying to .tolist() the column then trying to multiply it by 0. This just resulted in having the list be 0 which will affect our analysis and we didn't want that. Another method I tried doing was creating a new dictionary with the NaN values for the THS 9th graders using a for loop to check for the conditions, then replacing the values with NaN but it didn't seem right and I wouldn't be using the .loc method. After trying many times I learned that we can simply set our .loc df to a value which simplified everything! This truly was a learning lesson on how the pandas and numpy library can simplify analytics that other coding languages would have to brute force. Besides the coding aspect of this challenge, another difficulty of analysis comes from the limited data set. We can't see where the school spends their budget, and we don't have the information of math levels or reading levels of each student and only their score. Maybe a student might be at 6th grade reading level but is in 12th grade; but the school is known for its football program. There are many factors we can investigate that might narrow down to a solution to improve the overall reading and math scores.
